#### _Overview_

When using responsive images, we are dealing with multiple sizes and resolutions. If you're using the gulp task I provided to you in [1.14 Gulp for responsive images](?1.14.gulp-for-responsive-images), then you have 3 sizes: small, medium and large. If you changed the amount of images, then you'll have to change the code in the instructions accordingly.

The approach we're going to use for caching images is as follows:

* Images will be cached [on network response](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#on-network-response), so once an image has been cached once, the service worker can respond with it next time it's requested.

* Only one image will be cached, and that image will be served regardless of what image is requested next time. We'll do this by stripping the `suffix` and `extension` from the images. So if we have `img/1-small.jpg`, `img/1-medium.jpg` and `img/1-large.jpg`, the image will be cached using the `key` `img/1`. 
> You may be wondering why not save all images, but in a real world scenario, users won't be resizing the browser a lot, like we do when testing our app, so that means that the first image to be fetched from the network is **most likely** the best image to cache. This is specially true if the image is being fetched from a small device. Also, we need to remember that there is a limit to how much cache storage we have access to, so is always a good idea to use the space wisely.

#### _Instructions_

1. In `sw.js` inside the `fetch` listener's conditional that handles requests from the same `origin` as our app, add a new conditional where if the `requestUrl.pathname` starts with `img/`, where our images are stored, it should respond with function `serveImage(event.request)`, which we'll define in the next step.

```javascript
/** Hijack fetch requests and respond accordingly */
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
  const requestUrl = new URL(event.request.url);

  // only highjack request made to our app (not mapbox maps or leaflet, for example)
  if (requestUrl.origin === location.origin) {

    // Since requests made to restaurant.html have search params (like ?id=1), the url can't be used as the
    // key to access the cache, so just respondWith restaurant.html if pathname startsWith '/restaurant.html'
    if (requestUrl.pathname.startsWith('/restaurant.html')) {
      event.respondWith(caches.match('/restaurant.html'));
      return; // Done handling request, so exit early.
    }

~mark\    // If the request pathname starts with /img, then we need to handle images.
    if (requestUrl.pathname.startsWith('/img')) {
      event.respondWith(serveImage(event.request));
      return; // Done handling request, so exit early.
    }\mark~
  }

  // Default behavior: respond with cached elements, if any, falling back to network.
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then(function(response) {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});
```

2. Now define the `serveImage()` function, so it can handle caching of responsive images [on network response](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#on-network-response). We'll only cache one image by stripping the `suffix` and `extension` from the url.

```javascript
function serveImage(request) {
  let imageStorageUrl = request.url;

  // Make a new URL with a stripped suffix and extension from the request url
  // i.e. /img/1-medium.jpg  will become  /img/1
  // we'll use this as the KEY for storing image into cache
  imageStorageUrl = imageStorageUrl.replace(/-small\.\w{3}|-medium\.\w{3}|-large\.\w{3}/i, '');

  return caches.open(contentImgsCache).then(function(cache) {
    return cache.match(imageStorageUrl).then(function(response) {
      // if image is in cache, return it, else fetch from network, cache a clone, then return network response
      return response || fetch(request).then(function(networkResponse) {
        cache.put(imageStorageUrl, networkResponse.clone());
        return networkResponse;
      });
    });
  });
}
```
> NOTE: if you made changes to the **suffixes** in your `.gulpfile.babel.js`, you'll have to change the code in this function to fit your needs. In the above code, I'm using regular expressions to strip the suffixes, but if you don't want to use regular expressions, you can manually check for each suffix using a loop, or a switch statement.

3. Now you can test your app, and it should be caching images. Any image previously cached should be available offline.

4. (Optional) Commit your changes to git and push to GitHub.
