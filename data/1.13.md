#### _Instructions_

In `restaurant.html` you have to fix the style for the `header`, `map`, `restaurant-container`, `reviews-container` and the `footer`.

As you have already seen, is easier to style individual parts of your `html` file, rather than trying to do it all at once. Just like in previous sections, for each of the above mentioned sections:

1. Style your **section** for small devices using `styles.css`. 
2. Use an additional `css` file for every new media query you'd like to add to your app. See example below.
3. (Optional) Commit your changes to git and push to GitHub.
