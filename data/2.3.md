#### _Overview_

Our new **Gulp** setup allows us to use javascript bundles and each bundle can use `import` statements to include other javascript code, or even `npm packages` like Jake's `idb` IndexedDB Promised. Currently when we run `gulp sync` we get 3 javascript bundles:

* `js/main.js`: To be called from `index.html`.
* `js/restaurant_info.js`: to be called from `restaurant.html`
* `sw.js`: to be used as the `service worker` to register.

But after introducing this setup, our app broke for the following reasons:

* We no longer need more than one `<script>` tag in our html files for local resources. We still need to use a `<script>` tag for 3rd party scripts like *leaflet*, but any local script now we can **bundle** in our javascript bundles by using `import` statements.

* In this setup our javascript is more strict. In both `main.js` and `restaurant_info.js`, we have a lot of `undeclared` methods. By `undeclared` I mean they are assigned a value without using the `var`, `let` or `const` keyword. In dev tools you'll see errors saying this methods are `undefined` because of this.

* We need to `import` `dbhelper.js`, `secret.js` and `register-sw.js` into our bundles. `dbhelper.js` and `secret.js` need to converted to modules with `export default` statements (so we can use `import <module> from './file'`), and `regiter-sw.js` can be `imported` without being stored in a module (just use `import '.file'`), since it's just meant to run code to register service worker.
  > To learn more about modules I recommend the book [Exploring ES6](http://exploringjs.com/es6/index.html). Check out the [chapter about modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#sec_modules-in-javascript).

* We're using a global `newMap` variable in our javascript files, but then we refer to it by using the keyword `self` in some places, and without `self` in others. When using a more strict Javascript we can't expect global variables to be attached to the `window` object, which is what happened before, thus being able to use both forms to refer to the same variable. Now we either initialized our variable as `window.newMap = undefined` or simply replace all calls to `self.newMap` with `newMap` and keep our `var newMap`. We'll do the latter, since adding properties to the `window` object is frowned upon, perhaps way more than using global variables.


#### _Instructions_

1. Remove the `<script>` tags that call `js/dbhelper.js`, `js/secret.js` and `js/register-sw.js` in both `src/index.html` and `src/restaurant.html`. Only the `js/main.js` `<script>` tag should remain, as now we're using *bundles*. Let's take some time to clean up, and remove the commented out Google Maps `<script>` tags.

```html
  <!-- Only script tags in index.html -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.3.1/dist/leaflet.js" integrity="sha512-/Nsx9X4HebavoBvEBuyp3I7od5tA0UzAxs+j83KgC8PU0kgB4XiK4Lfe4y4cgBtaRJQEIFCW+oC506aPT2L1zw==" crossorigin=""></script>
  <script type="application/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="js/main.js"></script>
```

```html
  <!-- Only script tags in restaurant.html -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.3.1/dist/leaflet.js" integrity="sha512-/Nsx9X4HebavoBvEBuyp3I7od5tA0UzAxs+j83KgC8PU0kgB4XiK4Lfe4y4cgBtaRJQEIFCW+oC506aPT2L1zw==" crossorigin=""></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/restaurant_info.js"></script>
```
> At this point you'll see less errors in your console, as we're no longer trying to call files that no longer exist.

2. **Declare** all your methods using the `const` keyword in `main.js` and `restaurant_info.js`:

  `main.js`:

  * fetchNeighborhoods: line 19
  * fillNeighborhoodsHTML: line 33
  * fetchCuisines: line 46
  * fillCuisinesHTML: line 60
  * initMap: line 74
  * updateRestaurants: line 118
  * resetRestaurants: line 141
  * fillRestaurantsHTML: line 158
  * createRestaurantHTML: line 169
  * addMarkersToMap: line 204

  `restaurant_info.js`

  * initMap: line 14
  * fetchRestaurantFromURL: line 69
  * fillRestaurantHTML: line 94
  * fillRestaurantHoursHTML: line 122
  * fillReviewsHTML: line 142
  * fillReviewsHTML: line 164
  * fillBreadcrumb: line 188
  * getParameterByName: line 198
  
  example:

```
  // main.js in line 19 declaring a method using const
~mark\const\mark~ fetchNeighborhoods = () => {
  DBHelper.fetchNeighborhoods((error, neighborhoods) => {
    if (error) { // Got an error
      console.error(error);
    } else {
      self.neighborhoods = neighborhoods;
      fillNeighborhoodsHTML();
    }
  });
}
```

3. Open `src/js/dbhelper.js` and `export default` your `class DBHelper`, then in both `src/js/main.js` and `src/js/restaurant_info.js` `import` `DBHelper`.
```javascript
// src/js/dbhelper.js line 4
~mark\export default\mark~ class DBHelper {
```

```javascript
// in both src/js/main.js  and src/js/restaurant_info.js add this line at the top
import DBHelper from './dbhelper';
```
> At this point your app should be working, except for the maps.

4. Do the same you did in step 3 for `src/js/secret.js`.
```javascript
// src/js/secret.js line 1
~mark\export default\mark~ class SECRET {
```

```javascript
// in both src/js/main.js  and src/js/restaurant_info.js import SECRET at the top
import DBHelper from './dbhelper';
~mark\import SECRET from './secret';\mark~
```

5. In `src/js/main.js` and `src/js/restaurant_info.js` replace any reference to `self.newMap` with `newMap`. Our Javascript is more strict now, so global variables aren't attached to `window`, which is what `self` is referring to right now.

```javascript
// src/js/main.js
// line 77
const initMap = () => {
  if (navigator.onLine) {
    try {
~mark\      newMap = L.map('map', {\mark~
      //...

// line 207
const addMarkersToMap = (restaurants = self.restaurants) => {
  // if either newMap or L (leaflet) aren't defined exit early.
  if (!newMap || !L) return;
  restaurants.forEach(restaurant => {
    // Add marker to the map
~mark\    const marker = DBHelper.mapMarkerForRestaurant(restaurant, newMap);\mark~
    //...

```

```javascript
// src/js/restaurant_info.js
// line 17
const initMap = () => {
  fetchRestaurantFromURL((error, restaurant) => {
    if (error) { // Got an error!
      console.error(error);
    } else {      
      if (navigator.onLine) {
        try {
~mark\          newMap = L.map('map', {\mark~
            center: [restaurant.latlng.lat, restaurant.latlng.lng],
            zoom: 16,
            scrollWheelZoom: false
          });
          L.tileLayer('https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/{id}/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg70?access_token={mapboxToken}', {
            mapboxToken: SECRET.mapbox_key,
            maxZoom: 18,
            attribution: 'Map data &copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, ' +
              '<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>, ' +
              'Imagery Â© <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>',
            id: 'mapbox.streets'    
          }).addTo(newMap);
~mark\          DBHelper.mapMarkerForRestaurant(self.restaurant, newMap);\mark~
          //...
```

6. We also need to fix one of our `DBHelper` methods. This method is trying to use `newMap` as a global variable, but since now we're using bundles, we need to deal with it differently. The method actually has a way to deal with this, but it was never implemented: the method is already receiving `newMap` as the `map` argument. Just replace `newMap` with `map`

```javascript
   static mapMarkerForRestaurant(restaurant, map) {
    // https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.0.html#marker  
    const marker = new L.marker([restaurant.latlng.lat, restaurant.latlng.lng],
      {title: restaurant.name,
      alt: restaurant.name,
      url: DBHelper.urlForRestaurant(restaurant)
      })
~mark\      marker.addTo(map);\mark~
    return marker;
  } 
```

7. Make sure the bundle creation for both `main.js` and `restaurant_info.js` was triggered. The terminal were you're running `gulp sync` should show what bundles  were created. You can also make sure the bundles are created by saving both `src/js/main.js` an `src/js/restaurant_info.js`, but if the `gulp sync` task is running smoothly, you shouldn't need to do this.
> **NOTE in the video I used a different `gulpfile`. Now the `gulpfile` correctly builds both `main.js` and `restaurant_info.js` bundles when `dbhelper.js`, or any other `imported` file is saved. At least it did at the time of testing. The only time it has failed to create all bundles, is when I put my computer to sleep, but I use Windows...**

8. Remove `js/dbhelper.js`, `js/secret.js` and `js/register-sw.js` from the service worker cache, as they are now part of the bundle, and don't exist in our `dist/` folder.
```javascript
// sw.js line 11
self.addEventListener('install', function(event) {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(staticCacheName).then(function(cache) {
      return cache.addAll([
        '/', // this caches index.html
        '/restaurant.html', //...
~mark\        // remove files from this list\mark~
```

9. `import` `./register-sw` in both `src/js/main.js` and `src/js/restaurant_info.js` but commented out. This will register the service worker, but to make development easier, we won't register it until we're done implementing indexedDB.
```javascript
import DBHelper from './dbhelper';
import SECRET from './secret';
~mark\// import './register-sw';\mark~
```

> You can go ahead and un-comment the line of code, and test your app offline. It should be working as before, but with the service worker enabled **Browsersync** may stop working from time to time. I also recommend not to enable the service worker right now, because using one at this point may lead to unexpected behavior having to do with the service worker serving cached assets. For that reason, I recommend you don't use the service worker during development, unless you're making changes to the actual service worker, and you need to test it.
