#### _Overview_

It's time to start working on Phase 2 of the Project. In this phase we'll be using an API server to fetch restaurant information. We've been using `data/restaurants.json`, but now we'll run a local `sails` server, and fetch content from `http://localhost:1337/restaurants`.

* The server repository is found in https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2. You don't need to fork this repository, since we won't be making any changes to it, but if you want to fork it before cloning it, go ahead.

#### _Instructions_

1. Clone the server repository into a completely different folder than the one your project is located. We'll name it `sails-server-stage-2`. For example, if your project lives at `/home/user/mws-restaurant-project` this repo should live at `/home/user/sails-server-phase-2`. 

```bash
# in a folder OUTSIDE your project folder
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2.git sails-server-phase-2
```
> We're adding `phase-2` at the end, because the server we'll use in phase 2 will be different from the one we'll use in phase 3.

2. `cd` into your `sails-server-phase-2` folder, and `install` dependencies.
```bash
$ npm install

# OR

$ yarn install
```

3. Now install `sails` globally:
```bash
$ npm install sails -g

# OR

$ yarn global add sails
```

4. Start the server:
```bash
$ node server.js
```

5. In your browser you should see the list of restaurants when going to [`http://localhost:1337/restaurants`](http://localhost:1337/restaurants), and a specific restaurant, by id, when going to `http://localhost:1337/restaurants/{id}` (for example: [http://localhost:1337/restaurants/3](http://localhost:1337/restaurants/3) will show restaurant id 3).
> Now is a good time to compare the data the sails-server is serving against the data stored in `data/restaurants.json`. You'll notice that the photograph information is different. In `data/restaurants.json` this property has the extension included, but in the sails-server, only the picture number is provided. Also, Restaurant id 10, is missing the property altogether. We'll deal with this when serving restaurant info.
