### _Overview_

We're going to clone and use a new Sails API server for the 3rd and final phase of our project. This server has new endpoints for getting restaurant reviews, and also a new endpoint for setting a restaurant as a favorite.

We'll refactor our code so our server uses this new API server in the `restaurants_info.js` file. Our `main.js` file is working as is, because we're still getting a list of restaurants from the server, but now the reviews have their own endpoint.

If you use your app as is right now, with our new Sails server running, you'll notice it says we don't have any reviews yet. This is because the previous Sails server included the reviews in the restaurant object. Since now review are given their own endpoint, we need to fetch them using that endpoint.

#### Getting all reviews for a given restaurant

The only endpoint we'll use in this section is the `GET` endpoint `http://localhost:1337/reviews/?restaurant_id=<restaurant_id>`. This endpoint will get us all reviews for a given restaurant by id. 

To see all endpoints refer to the [README on the sails server for phase 3 repo](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3#endpoints)

### _Instructions_

1. Clone, install and run the new [Sails server for phase 3](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3). We'll clone it into a **completely different folder** than the one your project is located, and name it `sails-server-phase-3`.

```
# in a folder OUTSIDE your project folder
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3.git sails-server-phase-3

$ cd sails-server-phase-3

$ npm install 

$ node server.js
```
> Since you already installed sails globally during phase 2, you don't need to install it during this step. But if you run into problems, go ahead and install it using `npm i sails -g` as instructed on the `README`.

2. Disable the service worker to avoid dealing with bugs due to the browser serving assets from `cache`. Simply comment out the `import './register-sw';` statement on both `main.js` and `restaurant_info.js`. 
> If you don't want to disable the service worker, just make sure the errors you're getting back aren't due to the service worker serving cached assets. Since we're not doing work on the actual service worker functionality, my recommendation is to disable it.

3. Since now we have a new endpoint for reviews, we'll create a new helper method in `dbhelper.js` called `fetchReviewsByRestaurantId`, and have it return reviews from the new endpoint. Make sure to place it inside the `DBHelper` class.

```javascript
  // in src/js/dbhelper.js inside the DBHelper class
  static fetchReviewsByRestaurantId(restaurant_id) {
    return fetch(`${DBHelper.API_URL}/reviews/?restaurant_id=${restaurant_id}`).then(response => {
      if (!response.ok) return Promise.reject("Reviews couldn't be fetched from network");
      return response.json();
    }).then(fetchedReviews => {
      // if reviews could be fetched from network:
      // TODO: store reviews on idb
      return fetchedReviews;
    }).catch(networkError => {
      // if reviews couldn't be fetched from network:
      // TODO: try to get reviews from idb
      console.log(`${networkError}`);
      return null; // return null to handle error, as though there are no reviews.
    });
  }
```
> I added some TODO comments, as we're going to come back to this method later to add indexedDB functionality. When developing, it is a good idea to add TODOs when you plan on adding functionality to your methods in future releases, or for any ideas you'd like to implement. Many editors, [like VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=todo%20highlight&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance), have extensions that highlight these comments.

4. On `src/js/restaurant_info.js` modify your `fillRestaurantHTML` method so it uses this new helper method. 
```javascript
// in src/js/restaurant_info.js
const fillRestaurantHTML = (restaurant = self.restaurant) => {
  const name = document.getElementById('restaurant-name');
  name.innerHTML = restaurant.name;

  const address = document.getElementById('restaurant-address');
  address.innerHTML = restaurant.address;

  const image = document.getElementById('restaurant-img');
  image.className = 'restaurant-img'
  image.alt = `Picture of ${restaurant.name}`;
  image.src = DBHelper.imageUrlForRestaurant(restaurant);
  image.srcset = DBHelper.imageSrcsetForRestaurant(restaurant);
  image.sizes = DBHelper.imageSizesForRestaurant(restaurant);

  const cuisine = document.getElementById('restaurant-cuisine');
  cuisine.innerHTML = restaurant.cuisine_type;

  // fill operating hours
  if (restaurant.operating_hours) {
    fillRestaurantHoursHTML();
  }
  // fill reviews
~mark\  DBHelper.fetchReviewsByRestaurantId(restaurant.id)
    .then(fillReviewsHTML);\mark~
}
```

>You'll find a call to `fillReviewsHTML`, a method that accepts a reviews argument, but defaults to `self.restaurant.reviews`. Since reviews are no longer stored in the restaurant object, we'll simply pass the reviews we get back from `DBHelper.fetchReviewsByRestaurantId()` to this method.

5. Reviews now have a `createdAt` and `updatedAt` property, but no `date`. This is the reason our app now shows `undefined` when showing the date each review was posted. Refactor your `createReviewHTML` method on `src/js/restaurant_info.js` to use the `createdAt` property instead of the no longer used `date` one. You also need to convert into a human readable format, since the sails server will return a *timestamp* or an *ISO 8601* time string.
```javascript
// in src/js/restaurant_info.js
const createReviewHTML = (review) => {
  const li = document.createElement('li');
  const name = document.createElement('p');
  name.innerHTML = review.name;
  li.appendChild(name);

  const date = document.createElement('p');
~mark\  date.innerHTML = new Date(review.createdAt).toLocaleDateString();\mark~
  li.appendChild(date);

  const rating = document.createElement('p');
  rating.innerHTML = `Rating: ${review.rating}`;
  li.appendChild(rating);

  const comments = document.createElement('p');
  comments.innerHTML = review.comments;
  li.appendChild(comments);

  return li;
}
```
> Here we're using the `Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString()`, which returns a date based on the user's OS settings. You can use other [conversion date getters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#Conversion_getter) if you want. You can even implement your own method to get a date formatted to your liking, or event import [*moment.js*](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/node-js/) using npm.

6. Test your app, and now you should be able to serve reviews from the Sails API server.

7. (Optional) Commit your changes to git and push to GitHub.
