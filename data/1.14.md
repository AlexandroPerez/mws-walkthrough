#### _Instructions_

1. Make sure you have node installed. The latest stable version should work.
2. Modify your `.gitignore` file to the following:
```
# ignore file with secret API key
js/secret.js

# ignore dependencies
node_modules/

# ignore logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
```
> It's important to ignore your secrets in a gitignore. Ignoring `node_modules` is also a good practice, along with any logs made by either npm or yarn.

3. Create a `package.json` file and add the following to it:
```json
{
  "name": "restaurant-reviews-project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.24.1",
    "babel-register": "^6.26.0",
    "del": "^3.0.0",
    "gulp": "^3.9.1",
    "gulp-responsive": "^2.11.0",
    "run-sequence": "^2.2.1",
    "sharp": "^0.20.5"
  }
}
```
> Now you can run your server by running `npm start` or `yarn start!` If you're using a different server, say python 3, change `"start": "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000"` to `"start": "python3 -m http.server 8000"`.

4. Create a `.babelrc` file and add the following preset:
```json
{
  "presets": [ "es2015" ]
}
```
> This will allow us to use ES6 features in our gulpfile, like `import`

5. Create a gulpfile named `gulpfile.babel.js` and add the following code to it. We're adding babel to the name to let others know they can use any babel preset found in `.babelrc` in this gulpfile.
```javascript
import gulp from 'gulp';
import responsive from 'gulp-responsive';
import del from 'del';
import runSequence from 'run-sequence';

// Create responsive images for jpg files
gulp.task('jpg-images', function() {
  return gulp.src('images/**/*.jpg')
    .pipe(responsive({
      // Resize all jpg images to three different sizes: 300, 600 and 800
      '**/*.jpg': [{
        width: 800,
        quality: 70,
        rename: { suffix: '-large'}
      }, {
        width: 600,
        quality: 50,
        rename: { suffix: '-medium'}
      }, {
        width: 300,
        quality: 40,
        rename: { suffix: '-small'}
      }]
    },))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('img/'));
});

// Just copy any other images to img folder
gulp.task('other-images', function() {
  return gulp.src(['!images/**/*.jpg', 'images/**/*.*'])
    .pipe(gulp.dest('img/'));
});

// clean img folder
gulp.task('clean', function(done) {
  return del(['img/'], done);
});

// Run this task for your images.
gulp.task("images", function(done) {
  runSequence(
    'clean',
    ['jpg-images','other-images'],
    done
  );
});
```
> We're going to use [gulp-responsive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-responsive) to make three different sized images: small, medium and large.

6. Rename your `img` folder to `images`. Now your original images will be in the `images` folder, and your responsive images will be in the `img` folder.
>If you checked the gulpfile, you'll notice that we're asking gulp to get images from the `images` folder (`gulp.src('images/**/*.jpg')`), and to save them in the `img/` folder (`.pipe(gulp.dest('img/'))`). We're doing this because we don't want to change the code in our html/js files to fetch images from a different folder.

7. Do an `npm install` or a `yarn install`.

8. Run `gulp images` to create your responsive images!
> When this task is done, you'll have you're new responsive images in your `img` folder.

9. (Optional) Commit your changes to git and push to GitHub.

## IMPORTANT TO NOTE

* The images in your app will be broken at the end of this section. This is because the naming of our images has changed (i.e. `1.jpg` doesn't exist anymore, instead we have `1-small.jpg`, `1-medium.jpg` and `1-large.pg`)

* Now all your images should be placed in the `images` folder, and called from your html/css/javascript using `img` folder.

* Whenever you add new images, run `gulp images`.
