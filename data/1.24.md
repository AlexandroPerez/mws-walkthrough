#### _Overview_

In the previous section we registered our service worker, cached the static assets needed for our app skeleton, and included some cache cleanup for whenever we release a new version of our app. But our app isn't working offline yet. For that to happen we need to have our service worker hijack all requests made from our app, and respond with with cached assets.

* [Cache, falling back to network](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network): In this section we're going to start by handling the majority of requests, by having the service worker respond with cache, then fall back to network if nothing was found. This will be the default behavior for the majority of the requests made by our app.

#### _Instructions_

1. Add a `fetch` listener to the `sw.js` file that responds with cache, falling back to network.

```javascript
/** Hijack fetch requests and respond accordingly */
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {

  // Default behavior: respond with cached elements, if any, falling back to network.
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then(function(response) {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});
```

2. Now you can test the app in `offline` mode.
> You'll notice that even though our app is showing up now, it's still broken. This is because the code that's trying to fetch the Mapbox maps is throwing an error, and stops the execution of code in both `main.js` and `restaurant_info.js`. We'll fix that in the next section.

3. (Optional) Commit your changes to git and push to GitHub.
