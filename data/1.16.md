#### _Overview_

So now that we understand how responsive images work, and had had **gulp** create some for us, we need make our app use these new images.

If you visit your app right now, images are broken, because our app is looking for files like `1.jpg`, but now we have responsive images named `1-small.jpg`, `1-medium.jpg` and `1-large.jpg`. We'll change the code that shows our images in `main.js` and `restaurant_info.js`.
> If you decided to change the sizes and prefixes in your gulpfile, you'll have to modify your code accordingly.

#### _Instructions_

1. In your `js/dbhelper.js` change the value being returned by the `imageUrlForRestaurant()` method. Instead of returning something like `/img/1.jpg`, we'll return a default to `/img/1-medium.jpg`. We'll use the medium sized image as default. Make sure to change the comment explaining what the method does.
```javascript
// dbhelper.js line 149
~mark\  /**
   * Restaurant image URL. It defaults to a medium sized image. It uses restaurant.photograph
   * and fallbacks to restaurant.id if former is missing
   */\mark~
  static imageUrlForRestaurant(restaurant) {
~mark\    let url = `/img/${(restaurant.photograph.split('.')[0]||restaurant.id)}-medium.jpg`;
    return url;\mark~
  }
```

2. Right after the `imageUrlForRestaurant()` method, we'll add two more helper methods in `dbhelper.js`. These helper methods will return the image `srcset` and `sizes` values.
```javascript
// dbhelper.js line 149
  /**
   * Restaurant image URL. It defaults to a medium sized image. It uses restaurant.photograph
   * and fallbacks to restaurant.id if former is missing.
   */
  static imageUrlForRestaurant(restaurant) {
    let url = `/img/${(restaurant.photograph.split('.')[0]||restaurant.id)}-medium.jpg`;
    return url;
  }

~mark\  /**
   * Restaurant srcset attribute for browser to decide best resolution. It uses restaurant.photograph
   * and fallbacks to restaurant.id if former is missing.
   */
  static imageSrcsetForRestaurant(restaurant) {
    const imageSrc = `/img/${(restaurant.photograph.split('.')[0]||restaurant.id)}`;
    return `${imageSrc}-small.jpg 300w,
            ${imageSrc}-medium.jpg 600w,
            ${imageSrc}-large.jpg 800w`;
  }

  /**
   * Restaurant sizes attribute so browser knows image sizes before deciding
   * what image to download.
   */
  static imageSizesForRestaurant(restaurant) {
    return `(max-width: 360px) 280px,
            (max-width: 600px) 600px,
            400px`;
  }\mark~
```

3. In `main.js` inside your `createRestaurantHTML` method, add a `srcset` and `sizes` attribute to your images, and use the helper methods we created above to set their values:
```javascript
// main.js line 161
  const image = document.createElement('img');
  image.className = 'restaurant-img';
  image.src = DBHelper.imageUrlForRestaurant(restaurant);
~mark\  image.srcset = DBHelper.imageSrcsetForRestaurant(restaurant);
  image.sizes = DBHelper.imageSizesForRestaurant(restaurant);\mark~
  li.append(image);
```

4. In `restaurant_info.js` inside your `fillRestaurantHTML()` method, add a `srcset` and `sizes` attribute to your images, and use the helper methods we created above to set their values:

```javascript
// restaurant_info.js line 89
  const image = document.getElementById('restaurant-img');
  image.className = 'restaurant-img'
  image.src = DBHelper.imageUrlForRestaurant(restaurant);
~mark\  image.srcset = DBHelper.imageSrcsetForRestaurant(restaurant);
  image.sizes = DBHelper.imageSizesForRestaurant(restaurant);\mark~
```
