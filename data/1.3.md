You have multiple ways to start a local server. Udacity recommends **python**. In order to use python, you need to have it installed.

##### Python 2.7
```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

##### Python 3
```
$ python3 -m http.server 8000
```

After running the server, now you can see your app live in [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
