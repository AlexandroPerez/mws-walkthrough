#### _Overview_

Right now the `view details` links in our app aren't screen reader friendly. When a screen reader user navigates our app, all they will hear is `view details` without any context. There are a few ways to fix this, like changing our links to something like `view details about <restaurant name>`, but there is a better way if we don't want to change the UI interface: `aria-label`. 

Go ahead and navigate each link using a screen reader like ChromeVox, with your eyes closed. Without context, you won't be able to tell what *detais* you're supposed to *view*.

#### _Instructions_

1. Add an aria-label to each generated link in `main.js` inside the `createRestaurantHTML` method. Set it to `view details about <restaurant-name>`. We'll use `setAttribute()` to add this `aria-label`.
```javascript
// in main.js inside createRestaurantHTML (around line 181)
const more = document.createElement('a');
more.innerHTML = 'View Details';
~mark\more.setAttribute('aria-label', `View details about ${restaurant.name}`);\mark~
more.href = DBHelper.urlForRestaurant(restaurant);
li.append(more)
```

2. Navigate your links using a screen reader like ChromeVox. Now is easier to know what *details* we're going to *view*, and didn't have to change the text in our UI.

3. (Optional) Commit your changes to git and push to GitHub.
