#### srcset attribute

The `srcset` attribute of the `img` element allows us to supply different sources for different image sizes. This attribute is useful for responsive images, as the browser can use the image that best fits the viewport.

```html
  <img src="default.jpg" 
       srcset="photo-small.jpg 300w,
               photo-medium.jpg 600w,
               photo-large.jpg 800w"
  >
```
> Each source consists of the location and width of the image. In this example we're providing thee different sources with width sizes of 300w, 600w and 800w. The image in the `src` will be used as the default image if the `srcset` attribute isn't supported. 

### sizes attribute

To improve page load times, we can make use of the sizes attribute to give the browser an idea of what image to load by providing media queries that tell the browser what _size_ the image will be based on the viewport width.

```html
  <img src="default.jpg" 
       srcset="photo-small.jpg 300w,
               photo-medium.jpg 600w,
               photo-large.jpg 800w"
       sizes="(max-width: 400px) 240px,
              (max-width: 800px) 500px,
              800px"
  >
```
> In this example we tell the browser that in viewports with a max width of 400px, our image will be 240px wide, in viewports with a max width of 800px, our image will be 500px wide, and in any other scenario, our image will be 800px wide.

### Both srcset and sizes attributes

If we use the `srcset` attribute but not the `sizes` attribute, the browser will fetch images based only on the viewport. **This is okay if you know your image will use 100% of your viewport's width, but most of the time your images will be contained inside other elements using less width than that of the viewport.** For that reason it is important to use the `sizes` attribute, as it allows you to get the best image based on media queries.
