#### _Instructions_

1. Style your `map` for small devices using `styles.css`. 
2. Use an additional `css` file for every new media query you'd like to add to your app. See example below.
3. (Optional) Commit your changes to git and push to GitHub. See example below.

> TIP: You can use devtools to change the style, as described in the video, and then copy and paste your code back to your css file.

#### Example

If you have two breakpoints, meaning you have three designs:

* `style.css` for devices between 0px - 599px.
* `style-medium.css` for medium devices between 600px - 1023px.
* `style-large.css` for larger devices.

Your `html` file should have the following `link` elements with queries:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 600px)" href="css/styles-medium.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 1024px)" href="css/styles-large.css">
```

### Example - Commit to git and push to GitHub

Make sure you're satisfied with your code before doing a git commit. In your terminal, in the root of your project:

```bash
$ git add .

$ git commit -m "<Replace with short message stating what you did>"

$ git push
```
