#### _Overview_

So far we have fixed our service worker to serve cached static resources, and prevented the lack of a map from breaking our app. But now we are running into another problem: `restaurant.html` isn't working.

#### How the service worker stores assets in cache

When the service worker stores assets in the cache, it stores the `pathname` and `search params` of the asset as the `key`. This means that when a request is made to `restaurant.html?id=1` the service worker will try to retrieve from cache an asset with the same `key`. 

So our problem here is simple, all we have to do is respond with `restaurant.html` whenever our app makes a request to the same page with any kind of `parameter`.

#### _Instructions_

1. In `sw.js`, inside the `fetch` listener, add a conditional statement that will return the cached `restaurant.html` when any request made to `restaurant.html` has `parameters`. We'll also make sure to hijack only requests made to our app, and not to any 3rd party resources, like mapbox or leaflet.

```javascript
/** Hijack fetch requests and respond accordingly */
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
  ~mark\const requestUrl = new URL(event.request.url);

  // only highjack request made to our app (not mapbox maps or leaflet, for example)
  if (requestUrl.origin === location.origin) {

    // Since requests made to restaurant.html have search params (like ?id=1), the url can't be used as the
    // key to access the cache, so just respondWith restaurant.html if pathname startsWith '/restaurant.html'
    if (requestUrl.pathname.startsWith('/restaurant.html')) {
      event.respondWith(caches.match('/restaurant.html'));
      return; // Done handling request, so exit early.
    }
  }\mark~

  // Default behavior: respond with cached elements, if any, falling back to network.
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then(function(response) {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});
```

2. Test your app, and everything, except images, should work at this poing offline.

3. (Optional) Commit your changes to git and push to GitHub.
