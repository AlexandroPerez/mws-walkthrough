#### _Overview_

[code example from video](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/stripe-dinosaur)

There are many approaches when it comes to styling our website/apps. But the one I'll recommend you to use is the mobile first approach.

In this approach we design from the smallest to the largest viewport your app will support. This means we'll start designing our app for mobile devices, and then add breakpoints for medium and big devices.

```css
/* First styles are for smaller devices with less than 600px of width */
body {
  background: red;
}

/* This applies to devices with a viewport between 600px and 1023px */
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background: green;
  }
}

/* This applies to devices with a viewport >= 1024px */
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  body {
    background: blue;
  }
}
```

##### Media queries in you link elements

In this walkthrough we'll be using media queries in our `<link>` elements, instead of the usual `@media` in a single css file. This will make it easy to manage your styles, and a lot easier to find the file where you have to change a given style.

###### Example

Say we want to add two breakpoints, so that we have three designs:

* `style.css` for devices between 0px - 599px.
* `style-medium.css` for medium devices between 600px - 1023px.
* `style-large.css` for larger devices.

In the `html` file we would load our styles as follows:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 600px)" href="css/styles-medium.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 1024px)" href="css/styles-large.css">
```

> It is up to you to decide how many css breakpoints you want to add. You can use one file for small to medium devices, and another for larger ones, just remember to make the design responsive.
