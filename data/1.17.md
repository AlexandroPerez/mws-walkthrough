In this video we'll be making sure our app is responsive. The Responsive design criteria, as given by Udacity, is as follows:

>On the main page, restaurants and images are displayed in all viewports. The detail page includes a map, hours and reviews in all viewports.

All you have to do is make sure everything shows correctly and works fine in differnt sized viewports. From small devices like phones, to bigger ones like latpotps and desktop computers.
