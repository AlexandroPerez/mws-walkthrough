#### _Overview_

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

Without the viewport meta tag, browsers in small devices, try their best to fit the content of your app by scaling it. This oftentimes means that users have to zoom in, in order to be able to use your app.

By using the viewport meta tag, you're telling the browser to set the `initial-scale` to 1, and to use the `width` of the `device-width`. Basically, the browser shouldn't do any guesswork when rendering your website.

Of course, by itself, the viewport meta tag is useless, unless you design a responsive application.

#### _Instructions_

1. Add the viewport meta tag to both `index.html` and `restaurant.html`
2. (Optional) Commit your changes to git and push to GitHub. See example below.

### Example - Commit to git and push to GitHub

Make sure you're satisfied with your code before doing a git commit. In your terminal, in the root of your project:

```bash
$ git add .

$ git commit -m "<Replace with short message stating what you did>"

$ git push
```
