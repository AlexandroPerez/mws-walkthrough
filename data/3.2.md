##### Sorry if video is too noisy. I recorded this during a break at work.

#### _Overview_

Since now our reviews have their own endpoint in the Sails server, we're going to upgrade our indexedDb Database, and refactor our code so

* Our idb database has a new `reviews` store for storing reviews.
* Our idb reviews store also has a `restaurant_id` index, so we can get reviews by restaurant id.
* After fetching reviews from the Sails API server, we store them into idb.
* If our app can't get reviews from the Sails API server, we try to get them from idb.

#### _Instructions_

1. In `src/js/dbpromise.js`:
  * Upgrade our idb database to version 2.
  * create a `reviews` store, and a `restaurant_id` index for this new store.
  * create a method called `putReviews` that will store reviews on idb.
  * create a method called `getReviewsForRestaurant` that will get all reviews for a specific restaurant by its id.
```javascript
import idb from 'idb';

const dbPromise = {
~mark\  db: idb.open('restaurant-reviews-db', 2, function(upgradeDb) {\mark~
    switch (upgradeDb.oldVersion) {
      case 0:
        upgradeDb.createObjectStore('restaurants', { keyPath: 'id' });
~mark\      case 1:
        upgradeDb.createObjectStore('reviews', { keyPath: 'id' })
          .createIndex('restaurant_id', 'restaurant_id');\mark~
    }
  }),

  /**
   * Save a restaurant or array of restaurants into idb, using promises.
   */
  putRestaurants(restaurants) {
    if (!restaurants.push) restaurants = [restaurants];
    return this.db.then(db => {
      const store = db.transaction('restaurants', 'readwrite').objectStore('restaurants');
      Promise.all(restaurants.map(networkRestaurant => {
        return store.get(networkRestaurant.id).then(idbRestaurant => {
          if (!idbRestaurant || networkRestaurant.updatedAt > idbRestaurant.updatedAt) {
            return store.put(networkRestaurant);
          }
        });
      })).then(function () {
        return store.complete;
      });
    });
  },

  /**
   * Get a restaurant, by its id, or all stored restaurants in idb using promises.
   * If no argument is passed, all restaurants will returned.
   */
  getRestaurants(id = undefined) {
    return this.db.then(db => {
      const store = db.transaction('restaurants').objectStore('restaurants');
      if (id) return store.get(Number(id));
      return store.getAll();
    });
~mark\  },

  /**
   * Save a review or array of reviews into idb, using promises
   */
  putReviews(reviews) {
    if (!reviews.push) reviews = [reviews];
    return this.db.then(db => {
      const store = db.transaction('reviews', 'readwrite').objectStore('reviews');
      Promise.all(reviews.map(networkReview => {
        return store.get(networkReview.id).then(idbReview => {
          if (!idbReview || networkReview.updatedAt > idbReview.updatedAt) {
            return store.put(networkReview);
          }
        });
      })).then(function () {
        return store.complete;
      });
    });
  },

  /**
   * Get all reviews for a specific restaurant, by its id, using promises.
   */
  getReviewsForRestaurant(id) {
    return this.db.then(db => {
      const storeIndex = db.transaction('reviews').objectStore('reviews').index('restaurant_id');
      return storeIndex.getAll(Number(id));
    });
  },\mark~

};

export default dbPromise;
```
> Make sure methods are comma separated `,` inside the dbPromise object. If you place a semicolon or no comma at all, you'll get an error. Remember that `dbPromise` is an object literal, so it's methods are comma separated.

2. In `src/js/dbhelper.js` refactor your `fetchReviewsByRestaurantId` method, so that it stores reviews using `dbPromise.putReviews()`, and tries to retrieve them, when a fetch fails, using ` dbPromise.getReviewsForRestaurant()`.

```javascript
  // in src/js/dbhelper.js around line 85 depending on your code
  static fetchReviewsByRestaurantId(restaurant_id) {
    return fetch(`${DBHelper.API_URL}/reviews/?restaurant_id=${restaurant_id}`).then(response => {
      if (!response.ok) return Promise.reject("Reviews couldn't be fetched from network");
      return response.json();
    }).then(fetchedReviews => {
      // if reviews could be fetched from network:
~mark\      // store reviews on idb
      dbPromise.putReviews(fetchedReviews);\mark~
      return fetchedReviews;
    }).catch(networkError => {
      // if reviews couldn't be fetched from network:
~mark\      // try to get reviews from idb
      console.log(`${networkError}, trying idb.`);
      return dbPromise.getReviewsForRestaurant(restaurant_id).then(idbReviews => {
        // if no reviews were found on idb return null
        if (idbReviews.length < 1) return null;
        return idbReviews;
      });\mark~
    });
  }
```

3. It's time to test your app. By now restaurants and reviews are being stored in their own idb stores. Enable your service worker in both `src/js/main.js` and `src/js/restaurant_info.js`, then back in the browser do some testing.
```javascript
// in both src/js/main.js and src/js/restaurant_info.js
import DBHelper from './dbhelper';
import SECRET from './secret';
~mark\import './register-sw';\mark~
```

4. After making sure your app is serving data from idb when offline, disable the service worker again. You should also clear site data on the application tab, to make sure we don't run into problems later.
```javascript
// in both src/js/main.js and src/js/restaurant_info.js
import DBHelper from './dbhelper';
import SECRET from './secret';
~mark\//import './register-sw';\mark~
```
