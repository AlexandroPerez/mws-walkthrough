#### _Overview_

* `<html lang="en">`: It's always recommended to provide the language of your page in the `<html>` tag. 

* `role="aplication"` and `aria-label="application description"`: Use these in you the `map-container` section element. The `role="application"` attribute **is only** recommended here because the purpose of this section is to display a **map application** from Mabbox. [Be cautions when using this attribute as it shouldn't be used in many cases](https://www.marcozehe.de/2012/02/06/if-you-use-the-wai-aria-role-application-please-do-so-wisely/).

* `role="contentinfo"` and `aria-label="<section description>"`: Use these to describe all your content sections. The accessibility audit probably won't complain about `<section>` elements lacking these attributes, but adding them makes it easier for screen readers to navigate the sections in your app as well. 

* `aria-label` vs `<label>`: Use `aria-label` when you don't need a visual label, and a `<label>` when you do. Since our app doesn't need visual labels, we'll use the  `aria-label` attribute instead.
> If you were to use a `<label>` but need to hide it in the UI, you'd have to use CSS tricks to hide it. Why rely on tricks if you can use the `aria-label` attribute instead?

#### _Instructions_

In this section we're going to add aria-lables, roles and other ARIA recommendations to our app. See https://webaim.org/techniques/aria/ for more info, and to learn what else can you do to make your app even more accessible.

1. In you `index.html` file, change the following html elements to match the code below
```html
<!-- index.html -->

<!-- line 2 -->
<html ~mark\lang="en"\mark~>

<!-- line 22-24 -->
<section id="map-container" ~mark\role="application" aria-label="Mapbox Maps"\mark~>
  <div id="map" ~mark\aria-labelledby="map-container"\mark~></div>
</section>

<!-- line 25 -->
<section ~mark\role="contentinfo" aria-label="Restaurants Found In Your Area"\mark~>

<!-- line 28 -->
<select ~mark\aria-label="Filter by neighborhood"\mark~ id="neighborhoods-select" name="neighborhoods" onchange="updateRestaurants()">

<!-- line 31 -->
<select ~mark\aria-label="Filter by cuisine"\mark~ id="cuisines-select" name="cuisines" onchange="updateRestaurants()">
```

2. In you `restaurant.html` file, change the following html elements to match the code below
```html
<!-- restaurant.html -->

<!-- line 2 -->
<html ~mark\lang="en"\mark~>

<!-- line 24 -->
<nav id="breadcrumb" ~mark\aria-label="Breadcrumb"\mark~>

<!-- line 35-37 -->
<section id="map-container" ~mark\role="application" aria-label="Mapbox Maps"\mark~>
  <div id="map" ~mark\aria-labelledby="map-container"\mark~></div>
</section>

<!-- line 40 -->
<section id="restaurant-container" ~mark\role="contentinfo" aria-label="Restaurant Information"\mark~>

<!-- line 49 -->
<section id="reviews-container" ~mark\role="contentinfo" aria-label="Restaurant Reviews"\mark~>
```

3. Run an accessibility audit, and fix any remaining issues. Note that is likely you'll get warnings about lack of contrast in leaflet/mapbox maps, but you shouldn't worry about those. You should fix contrast if certain elements of your app need it.
> At this point you should be getting a score > 90 in Accessibility!

4. (Optional) Commit your changes to git and push to GitHub.
