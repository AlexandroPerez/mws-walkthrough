#### _Overview_

Right now if you try to access your app using `offline` mode in devtools, it won't work. The problem lies in both `main.js` and `restaurant_info.js`, which try loading **Mapbox** and if that fails, both throw errors and stop execution. We'll fix this using the following two features:

* `navigator.onLine`: This property returns the online status of the browser as `true` or `false`. This property seems like the perfect way to check for online status, but it's not foolproof. For example, the browser may still return `true` if connected to a network that has no internet connection.

* `try...catch`: This statement is used to *try* the execution of some code, and if for whatever reason that code throws an error, a response can be specified as a result of that error.

Also `main.js` will try to execute `addMarkersToMap()` and `restaurant_info.js` will try to use `DBHelper.mapMarkerForRestaurant()`, but if the map couldn't be initialized, this will cause both files to `throw` an error. We'll fix this problem by moving the code around, or simply preventing execution if the map couldn't be initialized.

#### _Instructions_

1. In `main.js` we'll use both `navigator.onLine` and `try...catch` to prevent errors from happening when trying to load **Mapbox**.
```javascript
// main.js around line 74
initMap = () => {
~mark\  if (navigator.onLine) {
    try {\mark~
      self.newMap = L.map('map', {
        center: [40.722216, -73.987501],
        zoom: 12,
        scrollWheelZoom: false
      });
      L.tileLayer('https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/{id}/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg70?access_token={mapboxToken}', {
        mapboxToken: SECRET.mapbox_key,
        maxZoom: 18,
        attribution: 'Map data &copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, ' +
          '<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>, ' +
          'Imagery © <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>',
        id: 'mapbox.streets'
      }).addTo(newMap);
~mark\    } catch(error) {
      console.log("Map couldn't be initialized", error);
    }
  }\mark~

  updateRestaurants();
}
```
> First we check if we're online using `navigator.onLine`, which if true, we `try` to initialize the map. If anything fails, we `catch` the error, and log it to the console without stopping script execution.

2. In `main.js` modify `addMarkersToMap()` so it exit early if either `newMap` or `L` variables are `undefined`. 
```javascript
addMarkersToMap = (restaurants = self.restaurants) => {
~mark\  // if either newMap or L (leaflet) aren't defined exit early.
  if (!newMap || !L) return;\mark~
  restaurants.forEach(restaurant => {
    // Add marker to the map
    const marker = DBHelper.mapMarkerForRestaurant(restaurant, self.newMap);
    marker.on("click", onClick);
    function onClick() {
      window.location.href = marker.options.url;
    }
    self.markers.push(marker);
  });

}
```
> `newMap` was *declared* in line 4, but it's value ins't initialied until the map is initialized. If the map couldn't be initialized, `newMap` will remain `undefined`. As for variable `L`, this is defined by **leaflet**. If we're offline, leaflet was never fetched from the network, which means `L` is `undefined` as well.

3. In `restaurant_info.js` use `navigator.onLine` and `try...catch` to prevent errors when tyring to load **Mapbox**. You should also move `DBHelper.mapMarkerForRestaurant` inside, so we don't try adding markers if the map wasn't initialized.
```javascript
// restaurant_info.js around line 14
initMap = () => {
  fetchRestaurantFromURL((error, restaurant) => {
    if (error) { // Got an error!
      console.error(error);
    } else {
~mark\      if (navigator.onLine) {
        try {\mark~
          self.newMap = L.map('map', {
            center: [restaurant.latlng.lat, restaurant.latlng.lng],
            zoom: 16,
            scrollWheelZoom: false
          });
          L.tileLayer('https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/{id}/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg70?access_token={mapboxToken}', {
            mapboxToken: SECRET.mapbox_key,
            maxZoom: 18,
            attribution: 'Map data &copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, ' +
              '<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>, ' +
              'Imagery © <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>',
            id: 'mapbox.streets'    
          }).addTo(newMap);
~mark\          DBHelper.mapMarkerForRestaurant(self.restaurant, self.newMap);
        } catch(error) {
          console.log("Map couldn't be initialized", error);
        }
      }\mark~
      fillBreadcrumb();
    }
  });
}
```
> Like in `main.js` the map won't be initialized unless we're online, or if that check fails, the `try...catch` statement will catch any errors. We also moved `DBHelper.mapMarkerForRestaurant` inside, since adding markers to the map shouldn't be done if map is offline, or it fails.

4. Now test your app in `offline` mode, and it should load everything except maps and images. We're making progress.

5. (Optional) Commit your changes to git and push to GitHub.
