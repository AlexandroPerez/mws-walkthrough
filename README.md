A walkthrough of the Mobile Web Specialist Phase 1 - 3 projects of the Udacity Project

## How to run on your computer

This walkthrough is live in https://alexandroperez.github.io/mws-walkthrough, but if you want to run on your local machine, simply clone the repo and run it using your favorite local server. For example to run on port `3000` using python you can use:
```
#python3
$ python3 -m http.server 3000

#python2
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```
And now you can access the walkthrough on http://localhost:3000/
