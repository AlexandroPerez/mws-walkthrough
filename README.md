# mws-walkthrough
A walkthrough of the Mobile Web Specialist Phase 1 - 3 projects of the Udacity Project

## Please don't just copy and paste, is for your own benefit.

I created this walkthrough to help fellow classmates get closer to the finish line, while providing an explanation of what the provided code does. That's why I suggested in the walkthrough to add comments in your code explaining, in your own words, what the code does.

## Let your reviewers know you're using this walkthrough

If you're going to use this walkthrough, it is your responsibility, as [stated by the Udacity guidelines](https://udacity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001451091-What-is-plagiarism-), to let your reviewers know that you used code from this walkthrough.

## This walkthrough only covers part of the project.

It's worth noting that there is not enough code for the whole project to be completed. The following has to be completed by you:

* Styling and fixing GUI issues on your app
* Implement image lazy loading
* Handling offline maps
* Marking of Restaurant as favorite while offline
* Adding new reviews while offline

The last 2 are the hardest requirements, but if you followed the walkthrough, you'll know enough to complete them on your own.

## How to run on your computer

This walkthrough is live in https://alexandroperez.github.io/mws-walkthrough, but if you want to run on your local machine, simply clone the repo and run it using your favorite local server. For example to run on port `3000` using python you can use:
```
#python3
$ python3 -m http.server 3000

#python2
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```
And now you can access the walkthrough on http://localhost:3000/
